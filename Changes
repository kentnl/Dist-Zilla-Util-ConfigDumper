0.003001 2014-08-27T22:48:37Z
 [Bugfix]
 - use instance->meta->find_attribute_by_name().
 - because: PACKAGE-> can't be used because roles don't work
 - because: dumpconfig( __PACKAGE__ , attrs ... ) assumes that the instance will have the attr
 - because: $instance->get_attribute() doesn't trace inheritance.

   were misguided.
